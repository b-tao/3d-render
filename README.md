# 3d-render

<p>Here is my 3d rendering engine in Java. Currently, it renders a cube that can be moved with the mouse. Various colors represent different sides of the cube </p>

<p>First, compile the project by running the command "javac *.java" in the terminal. Then, boot up the Display GUI by running the command "java Display" </p>
